Learning software development is a challenging journeyâ€”not only because the concepts are complex, but also due to the vastness of the field and the ever-evolving landscape of technologies. As a latecomer to the industry, I understand the feeling of being lost in "tutorial hell," constantly chasing the next big thing without allowing ourselves the time to truly grow our skills.

With this blog, my aim is to provide clarity and teach foundational skills that transcend the latest trends. I strongly believe that investing in and emphasizing basic concepts is invaluable for anyone pursuing a career in technology. This approach not only builds a solid foundation but also helps alleviate the anxiety many of us feel when faced with the need to learn new technologies constantly.

Having a strong foundation also makes it easier to acquire new skills, enabling you to recognize familiar patterns and understand that the latest trends may not be as revolutionary as they appear.

I will primarily delve into backend-related topics such as design patterns and principles, databases, and the core tenets of object-oriented design. Join me on this journey as we work towards covering a complete [backend roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/backend) with my
tutorials and posts.

**About me**
> After drifting aimlessly for the first quarter of my life, I realized a radical shift was needed. This led me to college, where I swiftly became enamored with software engineering and the principles of computer science. Through contributions to various research projects and years of hard work, I now hold a full-stack position as a Software Engineer at a reputable software company.
